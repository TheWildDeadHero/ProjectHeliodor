### About Me ###

Greetings! I'm TheWildDeadHero. Some of you may know me/have known me as TheDeadHeroAlistair, Alistair, or Don Patch (or a few other online handles I had for short periods of time). But from now on, you can call me TheWildDeadHero. I have been making Pok√©mon sprites on and off since 2005, primarily focusing on environmental sprites (tiles) and maps.

### Project Goals ##

Project Heliodor is a graphics project I've been working on for a few years now. This project was born from a few desires. For one, I always wanted to explore what Hoenn would have looked like if Game Freak had styled Emerald after FireRed and LeafGreen. I love the clean and reserved nature of FireRed and LeafGreen. That isn't to say Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald are bad, just that the games are a bit inconsisitent and I enjoy FireRed and LeafGreen more. Two, I've always wanted people to have a bit more variety when deciding to make a Gen III-style game. Everyone has been using a few variations of the same Gen III tileset for over a decade now. While I love FireRed and LeafGreen's style, everything starts looking too similar after a certain point. Third, I've always wanted to ensure the sprites have accurate palettes. PNG is great for keeping file sizes small, but it is still technically a lossy format and the many RPG Maker XP tilesets have quite a few tiles whose colors have shifted over the years. I always keep a backup BMP of all tile sheets to prevent degredation. Five, I've wanted to preserve as much as Pokemon Garden as possible. If you don't remember or were too young to experience it, Pokemon Garden was a free-to-play Flash game hosted by Yahoo! Kids Japan around the original release of Diamond and Pearl. It didn't have any battling, but did provide lots of information about the series of games in a look reminicent of FireRed and LeafGreen and had a few little minigames you could play with others. Because it was a Flash game, was Japan-only, and was taken offline around the release of Platinum, much of the game is lost.

### Tiled ###

Project Heliodor employs the application Tiled for sprite management, RPG Maker XP tileset creation, and non-Pokemon Essentials mapping. I'll cover this in a separate document. But to summarize, Tiled is a platform and engine-agnostic tool for making maps. Although its map format is incompatible with RPG Maker XP (and therefore Pokemon Essentials), Tiled is easily used to create RPG Maker XP-formatted tilesets from large tile sheets. To get the most out of Project Heliodor, please download this application at [Tiled at itch.io](https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled) (Thanks Thorbjorn for this amazing tool!).
